Using wget
  wget -r -A "*.jpg" http://example.com/images/
  
Using curl
  curl "http://example.com/images/ABC[0000-9999].jpg" -o "ABC#1.jpg"
  
      According to man curl:

      You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces as in:

      http://site.{one,two,three}.com

      or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

      ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt

      ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt (with leading zeros)

      ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt

      And explanation for #1:

      -o, --output <file>

      Write output to instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a number in the specifier. That variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:

      curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o "file_#1.txt"

      or use several variables like:

      curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"

      You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.

      See also the --create-dirs option to create the local directories dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash) will force the output to be done to stdout.
